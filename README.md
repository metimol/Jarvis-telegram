# Jarvis telegram
I have long wanted to make my own Jarvis in Telegram. I recently had a free minute and I did it. He knows how to correspond with you, as well as look up answers to your questions in Wikipedia. For its implementation, I used the Python language.

### Activate
To activate the bot, replace **os.environ['secret']** with the token you received from BotFather.
